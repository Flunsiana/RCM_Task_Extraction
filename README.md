# RCM_Task_Extraction

Since this code uses project data that is not freely available, it is not reproducible.
This Jupyter notebook code performs a series of tasks related to the extraction of radar surveillance data for agricultural land.
- Reads and prepares Geopackage and ZARR data.
- Defines functions for data conversion, rasterization, and attribute manipulation.
- Conducts calculations such as median over time and mask creation.
- Generates visualizations including mean radar signal over time and time series plots for masked and unmasked data.
- Refer to specific sections in the notebook for detailed implementation
